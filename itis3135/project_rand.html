                        <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
                        <p>There are many dynamic functions I want to implement in this site. I want to create a dynamic gallery of images for the gallery page, and a search bar for finding specific artwork. This functionality would be similar to a webstore like Amazon. Additionally Javascript would be used to dynamically change the information displayed on each page depending on what the user clicked.</p>
